Attack Scenarios (Mapped to OWASP Top 10)
Red Team must complete at least 6 scenarios, covering at least 5 distinct OWASP categories.
Below are safe scenario designs (no weaponized payloads). Each scenario requires: evidence + impact + fix.

Scenario 1 — Broken Access Control (A01)
    Try to access endpoints/actions you should not be able to
    Attempt role confusion (e.g., “staff” doing “admin” actions)
    Evidence: HTTP status, auth context, logs showing decision point

Scenario 2 — Security Misconfiguration (A05)
    Identify misconfigured headers, open ports, permissive firewall rules
    Evidence: scanner output + exact config path

Scenario 3 — Vulnerable/Outdated Components (A06)
    Show at least one outdated package/component with known CVEs
    Evidence: SBOM + vulnerability scan output
    Fix: patch plan + verification method

Scenario 4 — Identification & Authentication Failures (A07)
    Evaluate session handling, token lifetime, insecure defaults
    Evidence: auth flow mapping, token policy evidence (no secrets)

Scenario 5 — Software & Data Integrity Failures (A08)
    Prove whether builds/deployments are tamper-resistant
    If using GitOps, check if branch protections and artifact integrity exist
    Evidence: pipeline config review, signature policy or absence

Scenario 6 — Security Logging & Monitoring Failures (A09)
    Identify what should be logged but isn’t (auth failures, DB conn failures, VPN down)
    Evidence: “expected event” vs “observed logs”
    Fix: logging+alerts plan (ties into Labs 1B–4)

Scenario 7 — SSRF (A10) (only if you have a controlled endpoint)
    Demonstrate whether server-side calls can be abused to reach internal resources
    Evidence: architecture and allow-list checks, not exploit strings

Scenario 8 — Insecure Design (A04)
    Document one design decision that makes incidents harder (e.g., missing runbook, ambiguous ownership, no kill-switch)
    Evidence: written design critique + proposed control
