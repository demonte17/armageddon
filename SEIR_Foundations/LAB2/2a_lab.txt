Lab 2 Architecture

Internet → CloudFront (+ WAF) → ALB (locked to CloudFront) → Private EC2 → RDS

Key constraints
  No one can hit ALB directly (even if they know ALB DNS)
  WAF enforcement happens at CloudFront edge
  DNS points to CloudFront, not ALB


Terraform Overlay: lab2_cloudfront_origin_cloaking.tf

Assumes you already have:
  aws_lb.chewbacca_alb01
  aws_security_group.chewbacca_alb_sg01
  Route53 zone from Bonus-B
  WAF already exists (you’ll replace it with CLOUDFRONT-scoped WAF below)
